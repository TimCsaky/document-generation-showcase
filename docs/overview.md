## Summary

> Document Generation (DGEN) is a Web based service that provides NRM business users with the capability to generate standardized documents and letters using structured templates. DGEN implements capabilities similar to Wordâ€™s Mail Merge but DGEN is much more powerful. In addition, DGEN templates do not have to be rebuilt after every Word upgrade.   

### Capabilities  

- The capability to centrally share, access, and manage documents
- The capability to generate reusable templates for legal documents and form letters (e.g. permits & licenses)  
- A scalable document generation engine that allows multiple users to simultaneously generate documents  
- A library of document templates, secured by business area and stored in the document management system
